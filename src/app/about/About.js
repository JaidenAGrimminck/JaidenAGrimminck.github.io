                I’m a Dutch-Aussie-American student currently studying at Cornell University in the College of Engineering, 
                pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Robotics. <br/><br/>
                
                In the past, I’ve competed in various programs in FIRST, such as 
                FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge, as well as
                doing freelance work for various small firms. <br/><br/>
                
                On my own time, I love to sail, read, travel, and go backpacking.
