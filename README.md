# Personal Website

Hi! This is my personal website, made using NextJS/React. It's a minimal website, just an extended version of my resume, pretty much. 

You can view the website [here](https://jaidenagrimminck.github.io/).

## Deploying

Download the repository with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JaidenAGrimminck/JaidenAGrimminck.github.io.git
```

Open the repository with your command line, and run
```
npm install
```

You can run the website locally with
```
npm run dev
```

Or build with
```
npm run build
```

Then deploy with
```
npm start
```
